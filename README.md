Design is pretty off not gonna lie.
I'm having a hard time landing components right on React because the CSS structure is way different, and it gets over-saturated quickly with all the Components, divs and so on.

Will keep on improving both my React/programming skills & design.
Thanks for reading and have a nice day.
